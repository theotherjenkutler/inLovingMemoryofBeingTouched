MIDI Controlled Transcutaneous Electronic Nerve Stimulation

In Loving Memory of Being Touched is a series of touch simulation pieces written for direct electrical nerve stimulation - the closest thing to touch available in quarantine during The 2020 Novel Coronavirus Pandemic. Using components removed from a hospital communications system, the parts have been repurposed and assembled into handmade devices that simulate the sensation of touch using electrical pulses. The pieces are composed on an electronic keyboard to mimic the consonance and dissonance of musical passages to create a sort of song to be felt physically. 

In collaboration with web developer Daniel van der Meer (github.com/abudaan), a web platform based on WebMIDI is in development to allow users to create their own touch sequences, either with a MIDI enable electronic keyboard instrument or through the browser with a web based sequencer. Users can send their touch sequences to loved ones during quarantine or use the platform to create their own pieces to be shared publicly. The code for the platform and online player is available here:

This library is written for use with rkistner's Arcore usbMIDI Library available here: https://github.com/rkistner/arcore
Arcore requires an Arduino or Arduino compatible microcontroller with the Atmega 32u4 or "Leonardo" chip and Arduino version 1.5.7 - 1.6.13.

Anyone that uses this code and this schematic does so at their own risk. RTFM.
